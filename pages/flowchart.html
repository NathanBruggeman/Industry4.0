	<p>The storage can be simulated using the XYZ-table, this can be done by dividing the board in storage locations, an import location, and an export location. The head can then be moved between these places. It would be possible to 3D print a header and 'bulk products' and move these around.</p>
	<p>For the databases influxdb is the current database of choice, this can run on a Raspberry Pi, multiple can run on one to simulate multiple separate databases.</p>
	<p>The website can also be hosted on the same Raspberry Pi as the databases to keep hardware requirements for the simulation lower. To host the website Caddy is the primary candidate.</p>
	<p>Communication between all parts is done by OPC UA, using either Pup / Sub or Client-Server.</p>
